# finance_tracker
This is my first stab at making a more personally useful interpretation of Microsoft Money.
This is a work in progress, by a single amateur coder as a hobby project.
From concept, this project was started on 3/16/2025.

# Usage
 - Track all financial transactions made for a single household.
 - Track individual accounts, as well as the institutions where those accounts are held.
 - Track non-cash assets. (Real estate, gold?, etc??)
 - Track Payees and Payors.
 - Maintain and track spending categories.
 - Basic reporting on all of the above.
 - Basic DBDiagram here: [https://dbdiagram.io/d/Finances-6788aadf6b7fa355c30cd88a](https://dbdiagram.io/d/Finances-6788aadf6b7fa355c30cd88a)
